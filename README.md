Code for paper. 
Here we show how to estimate spectral fluxes of kinetic energy from 3rd order velocity structure functions.

Ackonwledgements:
- CARTHE project for data.
- Han Wang's github repo for some data munging tips.
- M Kuusela for introducing us to deconvolution and inverse theory literature.
